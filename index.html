        <p>
            HoopFund is dedicated to empowering young athletes by providing them with
            the necessary resources to thrive both on and off the basketball court. We

            aim to support the development of youth basketball players in underserved
            communities. 
        </p>

            Our mission is to ensure that every young player, regardless of their

            leagues and tournaments. With your support, we can create a lasting impact
            on the lives of these athletes, helping them build confidence, leadership
            skills, and a sense of community.
